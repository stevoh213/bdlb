# Refactor Tasks

This file outlines the tasks for refactoring the codebase.

## Task 1: Improve code readability

- [ ] Add comments to complex functions.
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions.
- [ ] Break down long functions into smaller, manageable ones.

## Task 2: Enhance performance

- [ ] Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate.

## Task 3: Update documentation

- [ ] Review and update existing documentation.
- [ ] Add documentation for new features.
- [ ] Ensure all code examples are accurate and up-to-date.

## Task 4: Increase test coverage

- [ ] Write unit tests for all new functions.
- [ ] Improve existing tests to cover more edge cases.
- [ ] Aim for a minimum of 90% test coverage.

## Task 5: Specific Refactoring Tasks

- [ ] **Refactor Form Logic in `ClimbLogForm.tsx` and `SessionForm.tsx`**: Extract form state management and submission logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useClimbForm`, `useSessionForm`) to improve component readability and reusability.
- [ ] **Create a Service Layer for Data Fetching**: Abstract Supabase queries and mutations from `useClimbingSessions.ts` and `useClimbs.ts` into a dedicated service layer (e.g., `services/climbingService.ts`). This will improve separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
- [ ] **Refactor Styling in `ClimbLogForm.tsx`**: Move the `tickTypeColors` object and conditional styling for tick type badges to a CSS module or a utility function to separate styling concerns from component logic.
